# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Aether Editor is a web-based, Canva-like video editor with a modern, premium user interface designed to support two primary workflows: manual editing for complex multi-track video projects and AI-assisted creation using external LLMs. The application features a powerful manual editor as its core, with AI workflow capabilities layered on top to provide a fluid, professional, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Preview and Playback

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to preview my video with accurate playback controls, so that I can see exactly how my final video will look.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks play THEN the system SHALL start playback with synchronized audio and video
2. WHEN the playhead moves THEN the system SHALL render the correct frame including animations and transitions
3. WHEN the user seeks to a specific time THEN the system SHALL immediately display the corresponding frame
4. WHEN clips have Ken Burns animations THEN the system SHALL render smooth position and scale transitions
5. IF transitions exist between clips THEN the system SHALL render cross-dissolve effects accurately

### Requirement 4: Asset Management System

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to upload, organize, and manage my media assets, so that I can easily access and use them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL generate thumbnails for images and filmstrips for videos
2. WHEN assets are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them locally and make them available to both frontend and backend
3. WHEN the user views the asset library THEN the system SHALL display all assets with visual previews
4. IF an asset is missing THEN the system SHALL display placeholder UI prompting for upload
5. WHEN assets are used in clips THEN the system SHALL maintain references and prevent orphaned content

### Requirement 5: Property Editing and Inspector

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to edit clip properties through a dedicated inspector panel, so that I can fine-tune timing, effects, and other parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a clip is selected THEN the system SHALL display its properties in the inspector panel
2. WHEN property values are changed THEN the system SHALL update the clip immediately and reflect changes in preview
3. WHEN audio clips are selected THEN the system SHALL provide volume controls and audio-specific properties
4. IF no clip is selected THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging in the inspector
5. WHEN properties are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide validation feedback

### Requirement 6: Video Export and Rendering

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to export my completed projects as video files with customizable quality settings, so that I can share or publish my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates export THEN the system SHALL provide options for resolution and format selection
2. WHEN export begins THEN the system SHALL queue the job and provide a job ID for tracking
3. WHEN rendering is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress updates
4. WHEN export completes THEN the system SHALL provide download link for the final video file
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and retry options

### Requirement 7: AI-Assisted Project Creation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to use AI to generate video project structures, so that I can quickly create complex videos from text descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens AI assistant THEN the system SHALL generate a master prompt including current assets and schema
2. WHEN the user imports AI-generated JSON THEN the system SHALL validate against project schema
3. WHEN imported project uses placeholder assets THEN the system SHALL prompt for required file uploads
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about schema violations
5. WHEN AI project is successfully imported THEN the system SHALL populate all timeline and asset data

### Requirement 8: Project Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want my projects to be automatically saved and restored, so that I never lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user makes changes THEN the system SHALL automatically save project state to local storage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the last saved project state
3. WHEN the user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL clear current state and storage
4. WHEN the user manually saves THEN the system SHALL immediately persist current state
