3. WHEN temporal operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle them without errors or crashes
4. WHEN multiple state updates happen rapidly THEN the system SHALL batch them efficiently
5. IF state corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and recover gracefully

### Requirement 4: UI/UX Consistency Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and polished user interface, so that I can navigate and use the application intuitively without confusion or visual glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL display them consistently across different screen sizes
2. WHEN interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN modals or dialogs open THEN the system SHALL handle focus management and accessibility properly
4. WHEN responsive layouts adapt THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and visual hierarchy
5. IF UI elements overlap or break THEN the system SHALL prevent layout issues through proper CSS and component design

### Requirement 5: Timeline and Playback Bugs

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want reliable timeline functionality and accurate playback, so that I can precisely edit videos with confidence in the preview accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clips are dragged on the timeline THEN the system SHALL update positions accurately and smoothly
2. WHEN playback occurs THEN the system SHALL synchronize audio and video without drift or glitches
3. WHEN seeking to specific times THEN the system SHALL display the correct frame immediately
4. WHEN clips are trimmed or split THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate timing and prevent overlaps
5. IF timeline operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options

### Requirement 6: Asset Management Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable asset upload, processing, and management, so that I can work with my media files without corruption, loss, or processing failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them completely without corruption
2. WHEN thumbnails are generated THEN the system SHALL create them accurately and cache them properly
3. WHEN assets are referenced in clips THEN the system SHALL maintain valid references and prevent orphaned data
4. WHEN large files are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently with proper progress indication
5. IF asset processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 7: Export and Rendering Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable video export functionality, so that I can consistently produce final videos without rendering failures or quality issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate the project thoroughly before processing
2. WHEN rendering occurs THEN the system SHALL handle all effects, transitions, and animations correctly
3. WHEN progress is reported THEN the system SHALL provide accurate and real-time updates
4. WHEN rendering completes THEN the system SHALL produce high-quality output matching the preview
5. IF rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery options

### Requirement 8: Memory Management and Resource Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to manage memory efficiently, so that I can work on long editing sessions without crashes or performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount THEN the system SHALL clean up all event listeners and resources
2. WHEN large assets are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL release memory appropriately
3. WHEN canvas operations occur THEN the system SHALL manage GPU memory efficiently
4. WHEN background processes run THEN the system SHALL limit resource consumption
5. IF memory usage becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup or user warnings

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that I can continue working even when issues occur without losing my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately for debugging
2. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery
3. WHEN recovery is not possible THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and provide clear guidance
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
5. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent further damage and offer restoration options

### Requirement 10: Browser Compatibility and API Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably across different browsers and handle browser API limitations, so that I can use the editor regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads in different browsers THEN the system SHALL detect and handle API differences
2. WHEN browser features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks
3. WHEN browser-specific bugs occur THEN the system SHALL implement workarounds or graceful degradation
4. WHEN storage APIs fail THEN the system SHALL use alternative persistence methods
5. IF browser compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL inform users and suggest solutions

### Requirement 11: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance, so that bugs are caught early and the application maintains high reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL have automated tests to verify functionality
2. WHEN bugs are fixed THEN the system SHALL include regression tests to prevent reoccurrence
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve test coverage
